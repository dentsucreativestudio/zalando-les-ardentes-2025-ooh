## 🛠 How It Works

- The `previewer.html` page uses the GitHub API to fetch all image files inside the `/images` folder.
- One image is chosen at random each time the page loads.
- The image is scaled to fit a simulated vertical screen (1080x1920px).
- Fallback support is included in case an image fails to load.

## 📎 Notes

- Ensure your images are optimized for web use.
- GitHub Pages automatically serves the latest version when the repo is updated.
